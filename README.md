NDA-Collection
==============

Collection of NDAs already deemed acceptable + guidelines


### So, you have an NDA for me to sign...

Develop a repository of existing NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements) that I have already read/reviewed and deemed acceptable. The other party, who wants me to sign an NDA, may pick one from the list and I will send them a signed copy w/o any charge (because it means I didn't have to read it, because I already have)

But, if they *really* want me to use theirs:

 1. It will cost $150, which is non-refundable, and with no guarantee it will ultimately be deemed acceptable.
 2. The NDA will expressly not apply to itself (excluding any personal contact information). After it has been reviewed and personal information has been stripped:
   - If it is accepted it will be added to the repository of acceptable NDAs.
   - If it is not accepted, it will be added to the repository of *unacceptable* NDAs
